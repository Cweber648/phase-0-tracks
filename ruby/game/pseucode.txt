Word-Guessing Game
- One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.
- Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.
- Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
- The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".
- The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.
