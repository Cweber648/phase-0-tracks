* Post requests submits data to be processed to a source.Post requests are never cached and do not remain in the browser. They have no restrictions on data

* You would use a post request where you are using more sensative data. Anything that you would not want stored or bookmarked would be using a post request. Also long requests because Post's have no character limits. Get requests are more usable and users can bookmark and store information.
