What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

#1
* The linux operating system was designed to give you full access to the computer and its operations. The OS assumes that you (the user) knows what you are doing and gives you access to everything. Open source software is the foundation of the linux philosphy. Meaning, anyone can access and modify their own operating system. It is public and available to anyone.

* A VPS from what i understand is a computer-less server. A cloud based server. There is no physical server it exists in the internet. You access it from your terminal. You can control this remote server from your own computer accessing it through the service or cloud. Much more affordable than a regular physical server.
* Advantages of using a VPS are, that you do not need to ever access a "physical" server. It is much more cost efficient. It allows you to be more flexible with what you can do with your site and its traffic, before having to invest in your own server. You can use one VPS to develop your site while using your other VPS to run the active site.

#3
* You never want to run a program as the root user. The programs are designed to be used by users ('mere mortals' from the website i googled). It counteracts the security measures in place. It leaves your program vulernable to bugs and issues.
