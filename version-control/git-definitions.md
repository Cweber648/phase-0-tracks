# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 - Version control documents changes in a project. It allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 - Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and countinue to do work without messing with that main line.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 - Commit is a save points in Git. Good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
 - Merge conflict usually occurs when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged. That is, you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa.
