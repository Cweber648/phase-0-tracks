# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

* Verison control is useful because you can go step by step while working on a project with other people or even solo.
* Verison-control allows you to leave detail messages about every change and save that you do.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 A branch is a way of being able to work on parts of a project while not effecting the master. A branch allows the user or teammate to work on parts of a project together. Make changes and then combine those changes later on.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 A commit is when you are committing your changes to be saved into the code. A good commit message is one that is very detailed. Short but detailed. Describes what exactly that bit of code you wrote did to the project.
* What is a merge conflict?
 A merge conflict is when you have some trouble merging branches together. It will pull up in the text where exactly there is a problem merging these two together.
