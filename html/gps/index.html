/*
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  -Semantic tags are to specify what you are trying to accomplish in a way. They define the content.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  -The browser displays the elements from top to bottom of the html page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  -I learned that sublime has a lot more features than we think. Snippets seem really difficult to understand, so I'd have to read up on them a bit more before creating my own anytime soon.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  -The most diffult was the snippets. Unfortunately, it was in the first or second release so we were a bit stuck to begin with. I also had a bit of trouble using the semantic tags. I plan to read up on all the tags used today.
